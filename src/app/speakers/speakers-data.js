   No "use client" here on purpose: page.js (server) builds the
   JSON-LD from this file, and Speakers.jsx (client) renders it.
   That keeps the schema code out of the client bundle.

   Before going live:
   - AS_SEEN_AT is empty on purpose. The "As seen at" strip only
     renders when it has entries. Add REAL past engagements only.
   - FAQ answers describe the service in general terms. Check that
     each one matches how you actually work.

  {
    q: "Do keynote speakers really need their own website?",
    a: "Yes. A bureau listing or a LinkedIn profile rarely gives an organiser everything in one place. A speaker website puts your topics, reel, past engagements, fee range and booking form on one page, so they can make the call without a back-and-forth. Organisers usually research a speaker online before they reply to anyone.",
  },
  {
    q: "What should a speaker website include?",
    a: "A clear list of talk topics, a short reel or clips from past talks, real past engagements and testimonials, a one-sheet, a way to check availability or request a booking, and enough SEO that people searching for a speaker on your topic can actually find you.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can you help me get booked for more events, not just look good online?",
    a: "Yes, that's the outreach side. We find program committees and event organisers who already book speakers on your topics, then send the outreach and follow-up that gets you onto their shortlist.",
  },
  {
    q: "How does cold email outreach to event organisers work?",
    a: "We build a targeted list of conferences, summits and corporate events that fit your topics, write the emails, send them on a schedule and follow up. Replies and booked calls land in your calendar, so your time goes to conversations with organisers who are interested.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is social media worth it between speaking seasons?",
    a: "It's what keeps you visible between seasons. Clips, takeaways and behind-the-scenes content from past talks give organisers a reason to remember you months after they first saw you, not just during conference season.",
  },
  {
    q: "Which plan is right for me?",
    a: `Start with ${planName("launch")} if you have no proper speaker website yet. Choose ${planName("presence")} if you also want social media and a professional email domain. Choose ${planName("growth")} if you want us to run outreach to organisers and put booked calls in your calendar. You can move up whenever you're ready.`,
  },
  {
    q: "How long before I see new booking enquiries?",
    a: "The site and reel are usually ready within the first couple of weeks. Outreach replies and shortlist mentions typically start in the weeks after campaigns go live. Timing depends on your topic and the event calendar you're targeting.",
