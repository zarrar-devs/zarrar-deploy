   -------------------------------------------------------------
   No "use client" here on purpose: page.js (server) builds the
   JSON-LD from this file, and RealEstate.jsx (client) renders it.

   Before going live:
   - SEARCH_TERMS are search patterns, not real places. They are
     written in plain language ("Realtor in your city") so no
     [placeholder] brackets ever show on the live page.
   - FAQ answers describe the service in general terms. Check that
     each one matches how you actually work (especially IDX/MLS
     setup and the outreach-compliance answer).
   - The copy is US/Canada-flavoured (MLS, IDX, zip code, realtor).

  {
    q: "I'm already on Zillow and Realtor.com. Do I still need my own website?",
    a: "Yes. A portal lead is often shared with other agents paying for the same zip code, and your profile sits next to their ads. A website that's only about you keeps enquiries yours alone, and it's the one piece of online property you fully control.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can my real estate website show live MLS listings?",
    a: "In most markets, yes, through an IDX feed tied to your MLS access. We set that up as part of the build. The exact setup depends on your board and brokerage, so we confirm what's available for your MLS before we start.",
  },
  {
    q: "How fast will I hear about a new lead?",
    a: "Speed matters more here than in almost any other business, because a lead that waits often goes with whoever answers first. We set up instant notifications so you can respond right away, and outreach follow-up runs on a schedule that doesn't let anyone go cold.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is local SEO for real estate agents?",
    a: "Mainly your Google Business Profile (categories, photos, posts and reviews), plus location-specific pages on your website that match how people actually search, like “realtor in your city” or “homes for sale in your neighbourhood”. It's what gets you found before a portal ad does.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is cold outreach to expired listings and FSBOs allowed?",
    a: "Rules differ by country and state, and email and phone outreach are regulated differently. In the US, for example, email falls under CAN-SPAM and phone calls under Do Not Call rules. We confirm what's allowed in your market before any campaign goes out, and your brokerage's compliance team should have the final say.",
  },
  {
    q: "Which plan is right for me, and is social media included?",
    a: `Start with ${planName("launch")} if you need a proper website and local SEO. ${planName("presence")} adds social media management, an Instagram build-out and a custom email domain. ${planName("growth")} adds outreach and booked calls. Social media is part of ${planName("presence")} and ${planName("growth")}, sized to your market once we know your patch. Book a call for a quote.`,
  },
  {
    q: "How long before I see new enquiries?",
    a: "The website and Google Business Profile updates are usually live within the first couple of weeks. Outreach replies and showing requests typically start in the weeks after campaigns go out, while local rankings build over a few months. Timing depends on your market, price point and how competitive your area is.",
