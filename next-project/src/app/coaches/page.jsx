   Zarrar — /for-coaches            (app/for-coaches/page.jsx)
   -------------------------------------------------------------
   This is a SERVER component on purpose (no "use client"):
   - metadata + JSON-LD live in the same file as the content
   - the markup ships as plain HTML, so Googlebot doesn't need JS
     to read a single word
   - only <CoachesMotion /> (GSAP) and <ContactProvider /> (modal
     state) are hydrated on the client

   Files in this folder:
     page.jsx               ← this file (content, SEO, markup)
     CoachesMotion.jsx       ← all GSAP animation (client)
     ContactProvider.jsx     ← modal state + context (client)
     ContactTriggerLink.jsx  ← link that opens the modal (client)
     coaches.css             ← styles, fully scoped under .coaches-page

   CLONING FOR OTHER PERSONAS
   Rewrite everything above the "SHARED" line per persona:
   URL/constants, title, description, H1, sub-copy, pain points,
   FAQs. Google punishes near-duplicate pages, so the persona-
   specific part must be the bulk of each page — different
   title, H1, intro, pain points and FAQ answers every time.

   Lines marked VERIFY are claims I added — confirm they're true.

const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "Does a coaching business actually need a website?",
    a: "Yes. Even when most of your clients come from referrals or social media, people check your website before they book a call. It's also the one place you fully own: Instagram reach can change overnight, a website you control doesn't.",
  },
  {
    q: "What should a coach's website include?",
    a: "A clear statement of who you help and how, a way to book a call without emailing back and forth, some proof you know what you're doing, and enough on-page SEO that people searching for a coach like you can actually find you.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much do a coaching website and lead generation cost?",
    a: "It depends on where you start. Launch covers the website, Presence adds social media management and a custom email domain, and Growth adds cold outreach and lead generation. Tell us about your niche and goals and we'll recommend the plan that fits.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is social media management worth it if I'm not a content creator?",
    a: "It's less about content skill and more about consistency. Most coaches stop posting because it becomes one more job. We handle the planning, posting and replies, so the account keeps showing up even when you're busy with clients.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can you get me coaching leads without me doing outreach myself?",
    a: "Yes. We write the outreach, send it, and manage replies and follow-up. You get booked calls on your calendar, not a spreadsheet of contacts to chase.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long before I see booked discovery calls?",
    a: "The website and socials are usually live within the first couple of weeks. Outreach replies and the first calls typically start in the following few weeks once campaigns are running. It depends on your niche and offer, but you're not waiting months for movement.",
  },
  {
    q: "What's the difference between the Launch, Presence and Growth plans?",
    a: "Each plan includes everything in the one before it. Launch is the website and on-page SEO. Presence adds social media management, an Instagram handle and a custom email domain. Growth adds cold outreach campaigns and lead generation, with booked calls in your calendar.",
  },
  {
    // VERIFY: confirm you're happy to say this about niches.
    q: "Do you work with every type of coach?",
    a: "We work with independent coaches and coaching businesses across niches, from life and career coaching to business, executive and health coaching. If you sell 1:1 or group programs and want more qualified enquiries, this page is for you. Not sure your niche fits? Send us a message and we'll tell you honestly.",
