  {
    q: "Why does a founder or CEO need a personal website as well as a company site?",
    a: "Because people look up the person before they back, hire or partner with the company. A company site explains the product. A founder site explains why you're the one to build it, and it's the one page in your search results that you fully control.",
  },
  {
    q: "What should a CEO or founder portfolio website include?",
    a: "A clear line on what you do and for whom, your track record and case studies, press and proof, what you're working on now, and one obvious way to get in touch or book a call. Underneath that: fast load times, a mobile-first layout and proper on-page SEO.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can you help me rank on Google for my own name?",
    a: "A proper founder website is the strongest first step: a fast, well-structured site with your name, role and company in the right places, structured data, and social profiles that link back to it. Nobody can guarantee a ranking, because it depends on how much competition your name and category have, but this is the foundation every ranking is built on.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is cold email still effective for founders and CEOs?",
    a: "It works when the list is targeted, the message is relevant and the sending setup is technically sound: authenticated domains, sensible volumes and an easy way to opt out. Blasting a generic email to a huge list doesn't. We handle the research, copy, sending and follow-up.",
  },
  {
    q: "What are SPF, DKIM and DMARC, and why do they matter for outreach?",
    a: "They're three DNS records that prove your emails really come from your domain. SPF lists who may send for you, DKIM signs each message, and DMARC tells inboxes what to do with mail that fails the checks. Without them, outreach and newsletters are far more likely to land in spam. We set all three up before anything is sent.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does social media matter for a busy CEO?",
    a: "Usually it's where investors, candidates and customers check you out first. You don't need to become a content creator. We plan the content, write it in your voice, post it and handle replies, so the account keeps working while you run the company.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I start with just a website and add email or social media later?",
    a: "Yes. Each plan builds on the one before it, so you can start with the website and move up whenever you're ready. Most founders find the pieces work harder together, because the site gives every email and post somewhere credible to land.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long before we see results?",
    a: "The website and profiles typically go live in the first few weeks. Outreach replies and conversations tend to follow once campaigns are running. Timing depends on your market and offer, and we'll be upfront about it on a call.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much does it cost?",
    a: "It depends on scope. The three plans above (Launch, Presence and Growth) are starting points, and we'll give you a clear quote after a short call.",
